This contains all code used to explore the datasets found in the `/CleanData` directory, which were previously generated in the `/Scripts/Cleaning.rmd` file. 

```{r}
monthly <- read.csv("../CleanData/monthly.csv")

#looking at when the bill was implemented
monthly %>% 
  group_by(bill8) %>% 
  slice(1:3)


ggplot(monthly, aes(month_year, Deaths))+
  geom_line()+
   geom_hline(yintercept = c("2021-08-01", "2021-08-01"),linetype = 2)
